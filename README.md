How It Works (Basic Flow)
User interacts with the bot via WhatsApp (via Twilio API).
main.py receives the message and routes it through message_router.py.
Based on detected intent, it forwards the message to relevant modules:
invoice_reminder for due dates
ledger and granite for forecasting
loan for credit advisory
tax for tax estimation
AI responses are generated using Granite 13B or Vision models as needed.
Responses are sent back to the user via WhatsApp in conversational format.
